# README

I set up a simple rails project with a home page and controller.  I leveraged the open source code for a similar project, found here: https://codepen.io/Conor092/pen/OZPMKd.

I did run into an issue with an uncaught reference in the javascript but with a little more time, I could have that fixed.  The main files are in app/views/home/index.html.erb and app/javascript/custom/wordfind.js.  I modified the JS file to only use vertical and horizontal placement and to ignore the other possible placement options.
